## Adder

**Description:**

A word in the LC-3 is 16 bits. Therefore arithmetic operations can be made easily on numbers no larger than 32767.
This program provides the possibility to add numbers larger than the limitation of a single register/location in memory.
It takes as input two numbers from 0 to 10^100 and returns their sum. Further explanation, design and implementation is
given in the code itself.

**Usage:**

This assembly program was written on the LC-3 version 1.06: https://github.com/chiragsakhuja/lc3tools/releases
Versions 2.0 and above are not guaranteed to be compatible with it. In order to run Adder, follow the link,
install the lC-3 on your computer, and use the .asm file to compile a .obj file which will be run afterwards.
Provide the first number to the LC-3 terminal, press ENTER, input the second number, press ENTER.
The sum of the two numbers will be displayed on the screen.
